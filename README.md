## Summary
The purpose of this code is to replicate the Windows 98 Minesweeper with some creative liberties. As well
as accurately utilize the powerful programming tool recursion.

## Technical & Gameplay Features
- Recursion is heavily used, even featuring a button to see the recursion in action.
- The first click will always be a tile with no mine.
- A 'Custom' option where you can set a grid of arbitrary size.
- A 'Functions' module to assist with calculating where the tiles are and the positional data associated with them.
- Accurate win and lose conditions according to the Windows 98 Minesweeper.

## Short Background
I completed this project in high school. It was my first proper coding project that was more than a short implementation
of an algorithm. This project solidified my choice to pursue Computer Science as a full time career.
